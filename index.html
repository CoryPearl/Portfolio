        I am a high school student trying to major in CS and eventually get a job in it. I've been working on a bunch of projects that interest/benifit me and I figured I should start putting together some type of portfolio. I am currently in 11th grade and I've been programing for 3 years. I started out with basic python freshman year of highschool. Then moved on to more python but also some html/css/js as well. This year im just doing python but I still have my side projects in html/css/js. Next year I will be working with java so hopefully that will be interesting.

          To me, google just wasnt great. It had too many distractions and I kept getting side-tracked. In addition to that I offten found myself searching for tools I use in development over and over again. To solve these issues I decided to try and make my own minimalist google search page that would open on google open. This page which I named "Bit" had html,css,js and python compilers, the weather and time, a scietific calcluator and a menu with links to my most comonly used websites. This was my first ever project I use consistantly. Even though it was relativly simple it was cool to make something actually useful.

            <span>Multiplayer Minecraft:</span>
            <br>
          In my class we had a open ended assignment, I was thinking of posible games I could make and 2D minecraft poped into my head. So I started making a web based 2D Minecraft when I realized I had never made a 3D game before. I thought this would be a great challenge to imporove my javascript skills. So using three.js (a 3D library made by MIT) I made a randomly generated world with sand, tress, dirt and rocks where you could just break blocks and place blocks. How ever we still had quite some time left for the project. So I took it a step further and made it multiplayer using node.js. Using sockets I manged to make a full fledged multiplayer game with a chat, player modles that point in right directions, player names and online player display. Some smaller things I incorperated were music with a mute and unmute button, fps display, flying mode and a coordinate system.

            <span>ByteNet:</span>
            <br>
          ByteNet is my biggest project yet. It is a social media website based around computer science. It has basic functionality of social media, you can firend people and messege them, post text, images and code snipits, read the news, and create a acount, sign in and change all your info including profile picture and bio. This project involved a lot of things I had never done before and a lot of problem solving. This is also my first full stack web app I've made. In doing this I also learned how to setup a ubuntu web server using DartNode, setup a domain name and get a HTTPS certificate. I also learned how to encrypt sensetive information such as passwords.
