        I am a high school student trying to major in CS and eventually get a job in it. I've been working on a bunch of projects that interest/benifit me and I figured I should start putting together some type of portfolio. I am currently in 12th grade and I've been programing for 3 years. I started out with basic python freshman year of highschool. Then moved on to more python but also some html/css/js as well. Last year I was just doing python but I still had my side projects in html/css/js. This year I will be working with java and python so hopefully that will be interesting.

          This year I'm taking IB computer science. The way it works is you do something called an 'IA' which is a year long project. So I decided to try to create my own verison of rpelit that allows you to code online with a team in java, python and html/css/js. So far I've created sign in, account creation, log out and now im moving onto creating the collaborative spaces. I'm also using a better storage systems than when I made ByteNet (scroll down to see), I do not have accses to a free SQL server so when I made ByteNet I stored everything in seperate etxt files but this time I'm using JSON to store and accses it easier and cleaner.

            <span>Multiplayer Minecraft:</span>
            <br>
          In my class we had a open ended assignment, I was thinking of posible games I could make and 2D minecraft poped into my head. So I started making a web based 2D Minecraft when I realized I had never made a 3D game before. I thought this would be a great challenge to imporove my javascript skills. So using three.js (a 3D library made by MIT) I made a randomly generated world with sand, tress, dirt and rocks where you could just break blocks and place blocks. How ever we still had quite some time left for the project. So I took it a step further and made it multiplayer using node.js. Using sockets I manged to make a full fledged multiplayer game with a chat, player modles that point in right directions, player names and online player display. Some smaller things I incorperated were music with a mute and unmute button, fps display, flying mode and a coordinate system.

            <span>ByteNet:</span>
            <br>
          ByteNet is my biggest project yet. It is a social media website based around computer science. It has basic functionality of social media, you can firend people and messege them, post text, images and code snipits, read the news, and create a acount, sign in and change all your info including profile picture and bio. This project involved a lot of things I had never done before and a lot of problem solving. This is also my first full stack web app I've made. In doing this I also learned how to setup a ubuntu web server using DartNode, setup a domain name and get a HTTPS certificate. I also learned how to encrypt sensetive information such as passwords.
